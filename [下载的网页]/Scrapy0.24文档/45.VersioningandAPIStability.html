<p>Scrapy uses the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Odd-numbered_versions_for_development_releases">odd-numbered versions for development releases</a>.</p>
<p>There are 3 numbers in a Scrapy version: <em>A.B.C</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>A</em> is the major version. This will rarely change and will signify very
large changes. So far, only zero is available for <em>A</em> as Scrapy hasn’t yet
reached 1.0.</li>
<li><em>B</em> is the release number. This will include many changes including features
and things that possibly break backwards compatibility. Even Bs will be
stable branches, and odd Bs will be development.</li>
<li><em>C</em> is the bugfix release number.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>0.14.1</em> is the first bugfix release of the <em>0.14</em> series (safe to use in
production)</li>
</ul>

<h2>API Stability<a class="headerlink" href="#api-stability" title="永久链接至标题"></a></h2>
<p>API stability is one of Scrapy major goals for the <em>1.0</em> release, which doesn’t
have a due date scheduled yet.</p>
<p>Methods or functions that start with a single dash (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_</span></code>) are private and
should never be relied as stable. Besides those, the plan is to stabilize and
document the entire API, as we approach the 1.0 release.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that stable doesn’t mean complete: stable APIs could grow
new methods or functionality but the existing methods should keep working the
same way.</p>
