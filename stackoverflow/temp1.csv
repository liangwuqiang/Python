<p>Here is a piece of C++ code that seems very peculiar. For some strange reason, sorting the data miraculously makes the code almost six times faster.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main()
{
    // Generate data
    const unsigned arraySize = 32768;
    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
    std::sort(data, data + arraySize);

    // Test
    clock_t start = clock();
    long long sum = 0;

    for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
    {
        // Primary loop
        for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        {
            if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                sum += data[c];
        }
    }

    double elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; elapsedTime &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""sum = "" &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Without <code>std::sort(data, data + arraySize);</code>, the code runs in 11.54 seconds.</li>
<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly. So I tried it in Java.</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Random;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Generate data
        int arraySize = 32768;
        int data[] = new int[arraySize];

        Random rnd = new Random(0);
        for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;

        // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster
        Arrays.sort(data);

        // Test
        long start = System.nanoTime();
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)
        {
            // Primary loop
            for (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
            {
                if (data[c] &gt;= 128)
                    sum += data[c];
            }
        }

        System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);
        System.out.println(""sum = "" + sum);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>With a somewhat similar but less extreme result.</p>

<hr>

<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the cache, but then I thought how silly that is because the array was just generated.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>
<li>Why is a sorted array faster to process than an unsorted array?</li>
<li>The code is summing up some independent terms, and the order should not matter.</li>

<p>Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">JSLint</a>, and it gave the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing ""use strict"" statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doing some searching, I realized that some people add <code>""use strict"";</code> into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.</p>

<p>So what is <code>""use strict"";</code> all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?</p>

<p>Do any of the current browsers respond to the <code>""use strict"";</code> string or is it for future use?</p>

<p>Programming language books explain that value types are created on the stack, and reference types are created on the heap, without explaining what these two things are. I haven't read a clear explanation of this.  I understand what <em>a stack</em> is, but where and what are they (physically in a real computer's memory)?  </p>

<ul>
<li>To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?</li>

<p>After reading <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/msg/33f173780d58dd20"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hidden Features and Dark Corners of C++/STL</a> on <code>comp.lang.c++.moderated</code>, I was completely surprised that the following snippet compiled and worked in both Visual Studio 2008 and G++ 4.4.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<p>What is the use of the <code>yield</code> keyword in Python? What does it do?</p>

<p>For example, I'm trying to understand this code<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>:</p>

<pre><code>def _get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist):
    if self._leftchild and distance - max_dist &lt; self._median:
        yield self._leftchild
    if self._rightchild and distance + max_dist &gt;= self._median:
        yield self._rightchild  
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the caller:</p>

<pre><code>result, candidates = list(), [self]
while candidates:
    node = candidates.pop()
    distance = node._get_dist(obj)
    if distance &lt;= max_dist and distance &gt;= min_dist:
        result.extend(node._values)
    candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))
return result
</code></pre>

<p>What happens when the method <code>_get_child_candidates</code> is called?
Is a list returned? A single element? Is it called again? When will subsequent calls stop?</p>
